# More Shearable Mobs!

A Minecraft 1.21.4 Fabric mod that reimagines how players gather animal-based resources — without the slaughter. Rather than killing passive farm animals, you can now shear them to obtain valuable items like leather, feathers, and even meat.

## Features

- ✂️ **Shear Animals Instead of Killing Them**  
  Shear cows, sheep, pigs, and chickens to gather resources in a non-lethal way.

- 🧥 **Custom Textures for Each Animal State**  
  Each animal has custom-made textures (by the mod author) that visually reflect their sheared and "meatless" states.

- 🔄 **Shear in Stages**  
  - **First Shear**: Removes outer skin/hide (e.g., leather from cows).
  - **Second Shear**: Harvests meat.
  - Animals are visibly altered after each stage.

- 🌱 **Regrowth Mechanic**  
  Animals regenerate both their skin and meat over time, modeled after Minecraft’s sheep wool regrowth. The regeneration time follows a bell-curve distribution:
  - **Average**: 50 seconds  
  - **Range**: Anywhere from 10 seconds to 2 minutes

- 🧵 **Lightweight and Non-Intrusive**  
  Integrates naturally into vanilla gameplay with minimal dependencies.
